# 2.2 Loops

**Loops** repeat a block of code. That way we can keep asking for a guess until the user gets it right, or run a game until it’s over.

## while loop

A `while` loop runs **while** a condition is True:

```python
count = 0
while count < 3:
    print("Hello")
    count = count + 1
# Prints Hello three times
```

If the condition never becomes False, the loop runs forever (infinite loop). So we usually change a variable inside the loop so that the condition eventually becomes False.

## for loop

A `for` loop runs once for each item in a sequence (e.g. a list or a range):

```python
for i in range(3):
    print("Number", i)
# Number 0, Number 1, Number 2
```

`range(5)` gives 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. You can use the variable (`i` here) inside the loop.

## break

Use `break` to exit the loop immediately:

```python
while True:
    answer = input("Type 'quit' to stop: ")
    if answer == "quit":
        break
    print("You said", answer)
```

## Project: Higher–Lower guessing game

The computer picks a random number. The user guesses; the program says "Too high!", "Too low!" or "Correct!" and keeps asking until they get it.

You’ll need:

1. **Random numbers** - at the top: `import random`. Then: `secret = random.randint(1, 100)` to get a number from 1 to 100.
2. **A loop** - `while True:` and only `break` when the guess equals `secret`.
3. **Conditionals** - compare `guess` to `secret` and print the right message.

Starter code:

```python
import random

secret = random.randint(1, 100)
print("I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.")

while True:
    guess = int(input("Your guess: "))
    if guess < secret:
        print("Too low!")
    elif guess > secret:
        print("Too high!")
    else:
        print("Correct! Well done.")
        break
```

**Ideas to extend:** Count how many guesses they needed. Give a limited number of tries (e.g. 10). Ask if they want to play again (another loop).
