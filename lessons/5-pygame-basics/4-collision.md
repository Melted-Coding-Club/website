# 5.4 Collision and game logic

**Collision** means “did two things touch?”. For rectangles we use `rect.colliderect(other_rect)`. When the player rect hits an obstacle rect, we can end the game, add a point, or trigger a jump - that’s **game logic**.

## colliderect

Pygame Rects have a method `colliderect`:

```python
if player_rect.colliderect(obstacle_rect):
    print("Collision!")
    # do something: game over, score, etc.
```

It returns `True` when the two rectangles overlap (even a little), `False` otherwise. Use it in the game loop, after you’ve updated positions and before or after drawing.

## Keeping a list of obstacles

For several obstacles (e.g. many blocks or cacti), keep a list of Rects:

```python
obstacles = [
    pygame.Rect(300, 250, 30, 50),
    pygame.Rect(500, 240, 30, 60),
]
```

Each frame, loop over the list and check collision with the player:

```python
for obs in obstacles:
    if player_rect.colliderect(obs):
        game_over = True
```

## Moving obstacles (scrolling)

To get a “runner” feel (like Chrome Dino), keep the player mostly in one place and **move obstacles left** each frame:

```python
for obs in obstacles:
    obs.x -= 5
    if obs.right < 0:
        obs.x = 600   # wrap or remove and add a new one
```

Then check collision after moving them.

## Simple game loop structure

1. Handle events (quit, key down for jump).
2. Update: move player (e.g. gravity/jump), move obstacles, check collisions.
3. Draw: fill screen, draw player, draw obstacles, maybe score text.
4. `pygame.display.flip()`.

## Project: Dodge one block

1. One player rect (move with arrows or just sit on the left).
2. One obstacle rect that moves left each frame. When it goes off the left, put it back on the right (or at a random y) so it “comes again”.
3. If `player_rect.colliderect(obstacle_rect)`, set `game_over = True` and stop moving or print "Game Over!".
4. (Optional: draw "Game Over" on the screen and wait for a key to restart.)
