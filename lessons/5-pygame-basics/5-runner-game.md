# 5.5 Building a runner game

You now have everything to build a **runner** game like Chrome Dino: a character that runs (or stays in place), obstacles that scroll from the right, and a jump or dodge to avoid them.

## What we’re aiming for

- A **player** (e.g. a rect) on the left side of the screen.
- **Obstacles** (rects) that move from right to left.
- **Jump** (or duck): press Space (or Up) to jump; the player moves up then falls back (simple gravity).
- **Collision**: if the player hits an obstacle, game over. Optionally show "Game Over" and a way to restart.

## Jump and simple gravity

Keep two variables: `player_y` or use `player_rect.y`, and a **vertical speed** (e.g. `vy = 0`). When the player presses jump, set `vy = -15` (or another negative number). Each frame:

- Add gravity: `vy += 0.8` (or similar).
- Update position: `player_rect.y += vy`.
- **Ground**: when the player hits the “ground” (e.g. a fixed y), set `player_rect.y = ground_y` and `vy = 0` so they can’t fall through or jump again mid-air if you only allow one jump at a time.

Only allow jump when the player is on the ground (e.g. `if player_rect.bottom >= ground_y and event.key == pygame.K_SPACE: vy = -15`).

## Spawning obstacles

- Keep a list of obstacle Rects.
- Each frame, move them left. If one goes off the left (`rect.right < 0`), remove it and (optionally) add a new one on the right at a random or fixed position.
- You can add a new obstacle every N frames or with a random chance, e.g. `if random.randint(0, 60) == 0: obstacles.append(pygame.Rect(600, ground_y - height, width, height))`.

## Game over and restart

When `player_rect.colliderect(obstacle)`:

- Set `game_over = True`.
- Stop updating the player and obstacles (or clear obstacles).
- Draw "Game Over" (e.g. with `pygame.font` or a big rect) and maybe "Press R to restart".
- If the user presses R, reset: `game_over = False`, player back to start, clear obstacles, and continue the loop.

## Checklist for your Chrome Dino–style game

1. Window, game loop, quit on close.
2. Player rect at a fixed x, moving up/down with jump and gravity.
3. Ground line (optional: draw a line or rect for the ground).
4. At least one obstacle (or many) moving left, respawning when off-screen.
5. Collision → game over.
6. (Optional) Score: increase every frame or every obstacle passed; show with text.
7. (Optional) Restart with a key.

## Ideas to extend

- Different obstacle heights or speeds.
- Power-ups (e.g. double jump, shield).
- High score stored in a list or file.
- Sound with `pygame.mixer` (beep on jump or game over).

You’ve gone from no coding to a playable game - keep iterating and adding ideas.
