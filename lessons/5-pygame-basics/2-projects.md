# 5.2 Coordinates and drawing

To draw and move things, you need to understand **coordinates** and **Rect** (rectangle) objects.

## Pygame coordinates

The screen uses the **bottom-left** part of a normal graph: x increases to the right, but **y increases downward**. So:

- **(0, 0)** is the **top-left** corner of the window.
- Moving **right** → x gets bigger.
- Moving **down** → y gets bigger (the y-axis is flipped compared to maths).

So “up” on the screen means **decreasing y**; “down” means **increasing y**.

## Rect (rectangle) objects

A **Rect** represents a rectangle: where it is and how big it is. You create one with position and size:

```python
# Four numbers: x, y, width, height
rect = pygame.Rect(100, 150, 20, 20)

# Or two tuples: (x, y) and (width, height)
rect = pygame.Rect((200, 200), (20, 20))
```

So: **location_x**, **location_y**, **width**, **height**.

## Reading and changing position

You can read the position with:

- `rect.x` and `rect.y`
- Or `rect.left`, `rect.right`, `rect.top`, `rect.bottom` (edges)
- `rect.centerx`, `rect.centery` (centre)

You can **update** the position by assigning to these:

```python
rect.x = 50
rect.y = 100
# Or move relative to current position:
rect.x += 5   # move 5 pixels right
rect.y -= 3   # move 3 pixels up (y is flipped)
```

## Drawing the rect

In your game loop, after `screen.fill(...)`:

```python
pygame.draw.rect(screen, (255, 0, 0), rect)
```

- First argument: surface (the screen).
- Second: colour as (r, g, b), e.g. red = (255, 0, 0).
- Third: the Rect.

## Project: A square on the screen

1. Create a Rect at (200, 200) with size (20, 20).
2. In the game loop, fill the screen then draw the rect in a bright colour.
3. Run the program and confirm you see one square that stays still (we’ll move it in the next lesson).
