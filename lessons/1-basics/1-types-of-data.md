# 1.1 Types of data

Computers work with different **types** of data. Knowing the main types helps you write code that does what you want.

## The main types

### Numbers

- **Integers** (`int`) - whole numbers: `3`, `0`, `-7`, `100`
- **Floats** - numbers with a decimal: `3.14`, `0.5`, `-2.1`

You can use them in maths: `2 + 3`, `10 / 4`, `3 * 5`.

### Strings

**Strings** are text. In Python you put them in quotes (single or double):

```python
"hello"
'coding club'
"I'm learning Python"
```

### Booleans

**Booleans** are either `True` or `False`. They are used for yes/no decisions. In Python the capital T and F matter.

```python
True
False
```

## Checking the type

You can see what type something is with `type()`:

```python
type(42)        # <class 'int'>
type(3.14)      # <class 'float'>
type("hello")   # <class 'str'>
type(True)      # <class 'bool'>
```

## Mini project: About you

Write a short program that **prints** your name (as a string) and your age (as a number). Use `print()` like this:

```python
print("My name is Alex")
print(12)
```

Try printing a sentence that uses both text and a number (you can pass several things to `print` separated by commas).
